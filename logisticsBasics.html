      Logistics Basics

    <div class="container justify-content-between">
      <h4 class="text-center">Do you know what logistics exists for or what it do for the costumers?</h4>
      <h5 class="text-center">Take a look of these important things üìù</h5>
      <br>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-4">This is the cornerstone of our entire business üí°</h4>
      <div class="border border-danger p-2 md-2 rounded-4">
        Logistics exists to support the efficient and effective flow of goods, services, and information from the point of origin
        to the point of consumption, with the goal of meeting customer requirements and supporting business operations. By managing the physical and information flow in the supply chain, logistics helps to ensure that products are delivered to customers in a timely, cost-effective, and
        reliable manner.
      </div>
      <br>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-4">The role of logistics in serving customers can be summarized in four points</h4>
      <div class="border border-primary p-2 md-2 rounded-4">
        <strong>Timely Delivery:</strong> By managing the transportation and storage of goods, logistics helps to ensure that products are delivered to customers on
        time, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and building customer loyalty.<br>

        <br><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Logistics helps to minimize the costs associated with the production and delivery of goods, such as transportation and
        storage costs, through the use of efficient routing, loading and unloading, and inventory management.<br>

        <br><strong>Improved Product Quality:</strong> By managing the storage and handling of goods, logistics helps to ensure that products are protected from
        damage and maintained at the required quality level, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction.<br>

        <br><strong>Increased Flexibility:</strong> By managing a flexible and responsive supply chain, logistics helps to ensure that customers can receive products
        in a timely manner, even in the face of changes in demand or supply chain disruptions.
  </div>
  <br>

  <h4 class="text-center mt-4">What about the distribution?</h4>
  <div class="border border-success p-2 md-2 rounded-4">
    Logistics has the objective of delivering exactly what the customer wants at the right time, in the right place, and at the right price. In planning for the
    delivery of goods to customers, marketers have usually looked at a process termed physical distribution, which refers to the activities used to move finished
    goods from manufacturers to final customers. Physical distribution activities include order processing, warehousing, materials handling, transportation,
    and inventory control. This process impacts how marketers physically get products where they need to be, when they need to be there, and at the lowest
    possible cost.<br>

    <br>In logistics, the focus is on the customer. When planning for the logistics function, firms consider the needs of the customer first. The customer's goals
    become the logistics provider's goals. With most logistics decisions, firms must compromise between low costs and high customer service.
  </div>
  <br>

  <h4 class="text-center mt-4">Did you know that...</h4>
  <div class="border border-info p-2 md-2 rounded-4">
    In recent years, the use of technology, such as transportation management systems (TMS), warehouse management systems (WMS), and supply chain
    management software (SCM), has revolutionized the field of logistics, making it easier to track and manage the movement of goods and resources.<br>

    <br>Overall, logistics is a complex and ever-evolving field that requires a deep understanding of supply chain management, transportation, warehousing,
    and distribution. It plays a critical role in ensuring that products are delivered to customers efficiently and effectively, and is an important area
    of expertise for businesses of all sizes.
